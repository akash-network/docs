## Before we begin

In this step, you actually use the testnet to deploy an simple web app, paying with your testnet ATK tokens.

To request tokens, please create an account on you local machine and ping us on our [matrix chat room](http://akash.network/chat) with your public key. The message should be:

To create a key, please make sure you installed Akash client on your workstation and run the below:

```
akash key create
```

You should see a response, similar to:

```
Key Name (required): bob
(info)  [key] key created

Create Key
==========

Name:           	bob
Public Key:     	44fc42cfff72666bbb02fc3a08545e89b35ea1ff
Recovery Codes: 	main nerve normal hill analyst iron weapon ordinary evoke sniff kitchen pyramid address apple direct inform skirt ozone stage market clown home fit height

(warn)  [Important] Write these Recovery codes in a safe place. It is the only way to recover your account.
```

The public key address in the above example is `44fc42cfff72666bbb02fc3a08545e89b35ea1ff`


Now, login to https://akash.network/chat and send a message, similar to:

```text
i want disco! 44fc42cfff72666bbb02fc3a08545e89b35ea1ff
```

## 1. Check your balance

To list your keys, run:

```shell
akash key list
```

To check your balance, run:

```shell
akash query account  
```

For, example:

```
(warn) please note, the token balance is denominated in uAKT (AKT * 10^-6)

Account Query
=============

Public Key Address: 	d09cd624066cd36be651107daf6879ef49086491
Balance:            	5,000,000,000                           
Nonce:              	0                                       
```

List your keys using `akash key list` command and query your balance using `akash query account <public-key>` command.

## 2. Create the deployment configuration and modify it if desired.

Create a deployment configuration to deploy a simple web app:

```
cat > deploy.yml <<EOF
heredoc> ---
version: "1.0"
services:
  webapp:
    image: quay.io/ovrclk/demo-app
    expose:
      - port: 80
        as: 80
        to:
          - global: true
profiles:
  compute:
    web:
      cpu: "100m"
      memory: "512Mi"
      disk: "512Mi"
  placement:
    global:
      pricing:
        web: 200u

deployment:
  webapp:
    global:
      profile: web
      count: 1
EOF
```

Alternatively, you can use cURL to download:

```text
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ovrclk/akash/master/_docs/testnet/testnet-deployment.yml > deploy.yml
```

The sample deployment file specifies a small webapp container running a simple demo site we created.

You may use the sample deployment file as-is or modify it for your own needs as desscribed in our [SDL \(Stack Definition Language\) documentation](../../sdl/README.md). A typical modification would be to reference your own image instead of our demo app image. Note that you are limited in the amount of testnet resources you may request. Please see the [constraints section](deploy.md#constraints).

## 3. Create the deployment

To deploy on Akash, run:

```shell
akash deployment create deploy.yml
```

You should a response, similar to this:

```text

(wait)  [broadcast] request deployment for group(s): global
(done)  [broadcast] request accepted, deployment created with id: e7f1117820510fa781435c2e3aca80f6d7c08c49d7e2411f1148ba7b0b85d161

========

Lease ID:    	e7f1117820510fa781435c2e3aca80f6d7c08c49d7e2411f1148ba7b0b85d161/1/2/43781206bcc5f8b676ada3eb56234b48568c22bbb4936d85cb5d5569d737a9c9

```
In this step, you post your deployment, the Akash marketplace matches you with a provider via auction, and your image is deployed. To create a deployment use `akash deployment`. The syntax for the deployment is `akash deployment create <config-path> -k <key-name>`. As you see in the above example, we have two providers bid on your workload.

The client will print the deployment id, bid, lease, and deployment data to console. Alternatively, you may also query your leases with `akash query lease -k <key-name>`.

You can access the application by visiting the hostnames mapped to your deployment. In above example, its http://wks5jlm8ykf3v6dzadtrrf.roy.akashtest.net

### Check the status of the lease

```shell
akash query lease
```

Should display a response similar to:

```text
Lease(s)
========

Lease: 	e7f1117820510fa781435c2e3aca80f6d7c08c49d7e2411f1148ba7b0b85d161/1/2/43781206bcc5f8b676ada3eb56234b48568c22bbb4936d85cb5d5569d737a9c9
Price: 	17
State: 	ACTIVE
```

## 4. Access your deployed application in whatever way makes sense to you

Check the application logs using `akash logs` command, with the below syntax:

```shell
akash logs <service> <lease>
```

For example:

```
$ akash logs web e7f1117820510fa781435c2e3aca80f6d7c08c49d7e2411f1148ba7b0b85d161/1/2/43781206bcc5f8b676ada3eb56234b48568c22bbb4936d85cb5d5569d737a9c9

```

You may also view your application logs with `akash logs <service name> <lease>`. The lease id is constructed as `[deployment]/[group]/[order]/[provider]`

For example, given a service named `webapp`, the lease in the previous has the below properties:

| Attribute | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| deployment | 66809b2c537fcdd79bc6b5b6d28bbf2d51fbe59133a4ba0119b9e0160ab16357 |
| group | 1 |
| order | 2 |
| provider | 49877504638723665f08dd57c2b0fbae79bd2abf65fe0d397e20880953b9befc |

So, the lease id would be:

```
66809b2c537fcdd79bc6b5b6d28bbf2d51fbe59133a4ba0119b9e0160ab16357/1/2/49877504638723665f08dd57c2b0fbae79bd2abf65fe0d397e20880953b9be
```

## 5. Close your deployment

Close deployment using `deployment close` command:

```shell
akash deployment close <deployment>
```

For example:

```text
$ akash deployment close e7f1117820510fa781435c2e3aca80f6d7c08c49d7e2411f1148ba7b0b85d161 -k alice

(wait)  request close deployment
(done)  deployment closed

Close Deployment
================

Deployment ID: 	e7f1117820510fa781435c2e3aca80f6d7c08c49d7e2411f1148ba7b0b85d161
Reason:        	TENANT_CLOSE
Height:        	18578
Hash:          	beea69622f8a3d8d6e691febeab09f03d6221e32c939d67a6cae3ab5e73db3c4

```

When you are done with your application, close the deployment. This will deprovision your container and stop the token transfer. This is a critical step to conserve both your tokens and testnet server capacity.
