# Desktop App

## Cloudmos Deploy Overview

The Cloudmos Deploy Tool is a desktop application which simplifies the deployment process on the Akash Network.  Post deployment the tool provides a dashboard to view the status and details of workloads.  The dashboard also has the ability to perform administrative tasks including closing the deployment, updating the deployment, redeploying, and increasing the funding available to the deployment.

This guide will cover the following topics:

* [Installation package download instructions and installation](akashlytics-deploy-installation.md)
* [Initial Configuration](initial-configuration.md)
* [Walkthrough of a example WordPress deployment using the tool](wordpress-deployment-example.md)
* [Manage Deployments](manage-deployments.md)
* [Define a custom RPC node](custom-rpc-node.md)

### Akash Wants to Spotlight Your Work&#x20;

Have an idea for a project to deploy on Akash? Already working on a project? Maybe youâ€™ve already deployed a project (or many projects!) to the network?

We love seeing what our community is building. Once your deployment is live, head over to our Discord and share the details of your app in our [Deployments channel](https://discord.com/channels/747885925232672829/771909909335506955) and tag @Admin.

Once you share your app, someone from the Akash team may reach out to spotlight your app across our newsletter, blog, and social media.

This is a great opportunity to connect with the team at Akash Network and to spotlight your work for our world-class community.
