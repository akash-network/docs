# Seed Funding

This guide will walk you through funding an account on an Akash network. Funding your network account is, of course, crucial to using the network - all messages charge a transaction fee, and if you are deploying applications then the leases for that deployment are paid out of your account. There are a number of different ways to fund your account. 

### Seed Funding

Developers can qualify for a small amount of tokens paid in AKT for the sole purpose of running their first app on Akash. To qualify for seed funding, please follow these steps:

1. Write a detailed post on [**forum.akash.network**](http://forum.akash.network) about your project including answers to the following questions:
   * **Problem Statement:** What is the problem you will solve?
   * **Impact:**  What impact will this project have?
   * **Goals:** What are you aiming to accomplish?
   * **Methodology:** How will this task be accomplished?
   * **Timeline:** What is the timeline for accomplishing this task?
   * **Team**: Are you looking for additional team members?
   * **Reporting**: How will you report your progress to the community \(e.g. weekly calls, reports\)?
   * **Design**: Do you have any screenshots?
2. Join the Akash Discord server [**discord.akash.network**](http://discord.akash.network) to introduce yourself to verify you are not a Cylon.
3. Provide your wallet address in the **\#deployments** channel and we will send up to $100 to support your first deployment.
