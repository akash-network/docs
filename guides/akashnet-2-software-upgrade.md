# Akashnet-2 Software upgrade procedure

## TL;DR
Software upgrades allows any cosmos based network to soft-upgrade the network to a new version. In general, for any state breaking changes, there will be a migration script to migrate the chain data and we generally hard fork the blockchain network. For soft-upgrades, `x/upgrade` module has a special function called upgrade-handler which handles all the migrations required. Here is the upgrade handler for `akashnet-2-upgrade-1`: https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/blob/147aaceb41eaf11ec49f3c151301a11bb361ae5f/app/app.go#L266-L271.

It handles 2 migrations:
- Fix vesting account delegation issues
- Set staking historical events to `10000`, which is required for IBC.

## What validators need to do before the upgrade time?

- Nothing, just sit back and relax. The `software-upgrade` proposal will force the binary (current version, `akash-v0.10.x`) to halt at specified height, i.e., 455200

## What validators need to do at the time of upgrade (i.e., at block height `455200`)
### 1. Cross check your consensus height:
```sh
akash status 2>&1 | jq -r '.SyncInfo.latest_block_height'
```
It should be 455199

### 2. Stop your akash service
```sh
sudo service akash stop
```

### 3. Get/Install new version

**Option-1: Using pre-build binaries**

   Download pre-built binaries from: https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/releases/tag/v0.12.0

**Option-2: Build from source**

   - Requires go1.16+
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ovrclk/akash
   cd akash
   git fetch
   git checkout v0.12.0
   MAINNET=true make install
   ```

### 4. Check your new akash version

```sh
$ akash version --long

[TBD]
```

### 5. Start your akash service
```sh
sudo service akash start
```

That's it. You should be able to check new blocks coming up.

## What if the upgrade fails?

Since we are not hard-forking the network, it should be simple to revert back.
- Stop akash service
- Re-install akash `v0.10.2`
   ```sh
   cd akash
   git checkout v0.10.2
   MAINNET=true make install
   ```
- Edit akash service file and change `akash start` to `akash start --unsafe-skip-upgrades 455200`
- Start akash service
