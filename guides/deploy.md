## Akash Testnet

The Akash testnet is a fully-functioning decentralized cloud, with support for requesting, deploying, and paying for cloud deployments. Server capacity is being kindly provided by Packet, the world's leading bare-metal provider. Access is **free** for registered users. As a free service, capacity is tightly managed, so please treat testnet capacity as the scarce community resource it is. In other words, please play nicely in our sandbox.

We want your feedback! Please message us [on chat](https://akash.network/chat) with any and all of your feedback. We're putting our in-progess platform out there so that we can get real-world feedback, so don't be shy!

Finally, some warnings. The Akash testnet is at an alpha-level stage of development and so **not intended for production use.** New functionality and capacity is being added constantly, but is always presented to you as-is, so use at your own risk. Use is at our discretion and we reserve the right to bring down deployments or to re-initialize the chain at any time for any reason.

### Intended users

Fundamentally, the Akash testnet is a deployment platform with a CLI and intended for relatively sophisticated users. If you are comfortable managing instances via the AWS API and can build and deploy a Docker container, you will find the Akash testnet easy to use. If not, please feel free to give it a shot, but you might find it confusing.

### Getting help
