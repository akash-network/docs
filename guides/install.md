# Install Akash

This guide will walk you through installing the `akash`application, creating and funding an account on an Akash network, and deploying a single-tier web application on Akash.

The software to run **Akash** and the command-line client used to interact with them are all distributed in the `akash`application. The `akash` command is used to run the Akash Network.

## MacOS

Before you install Akash, you will need to install the **XCode Command Line Tools**, and also we recommend using **Homebrew** to install Akash.

### 1. Install XCode:

You will need to install Apple's XCode Command Line Tools. Run this command in Terminal:

```text
xcode-select --install
```

### 2. Install Homebrew:

If you do not have Homebrew, you can install Homebrew using:

```text
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```

### 3. Install Akash:

Install `akash` using homebrew:

```text
brew tap ovrclk/tap
brew install akash
brew link akash --force
```

Once installed, verify the installation by running `akash version`

```text
akash version
```

## Linux

Download the archive for your system from the [release page](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash/releases), extract it, and install the `akash` binary into your path.

#### GoDownloader

Alternatively, install the latest version via [`godownloader`](https://github.com/goreleaser/godownloader) First, configure the version of the Akash Network `AKASH_VERSION`as a shell variable in your terminal:

```bash
# configure akash version
AKASH_VERSION="$(curl -s "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ovrclk/net/master/mainnet/version.txt")"

# install akash 
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ovrclk/akash/master/godownloader.sh | sh -s -- "v$AKASH_VERSION"
```

The final step is to make sure that the akash binaries are available in your shell `PATH`. [This page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14637979/how-to-permanently-set-path-on-linux-unix) contains instructions for setting the PATH on Linux.

Installing Akash suite from source

```text
$ go get -d github.com/ovrclk/akash
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ovrclk/akash
$ git checkout "v$AKASH_VERSION"
$ make deps-install
$ make install
```

Akash is developed and tested with [golang 1.16+](https://golang.org/). Building requires a working [golang](https://golang.org/) installation, a properly set `GOPATH`, and `$GOPATH/bin` present in `$PATH`.

Once you have the dependencies properly setup, download and build `akash` using `make install`
