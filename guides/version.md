# Choosing a Network

At any given time, there are a number of different active Akash networks running, each with a different `akash` version, chain-id, seed hosts, etc...

The generally available networks are:

| Network | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [mainnet](https://github.com/ovrclk/net/tree/master/mainnet) | Akash Network mainnet network. |
| [testnet](https://github.com/ovrclk/net/tree/master/testnet) | Testnet of the current mainnet version. |
| [edgenet](https://github.com/ovrclk/net/tree/master/edgenet) | Testnet of the next mainnet version. |

When following guides in this document, it is important to use the right parameters for the network you want to connect to.

The [ovrclk/net](https://github.com/ovrclk/net) repository contains metadata about each available network. The format is standardized across the networks so that you can use the same method to fetch the information for any of them. See [below](version.md#obtaining-the-data) for how to use [ovrclk/net](https://github.com/ovrclk/net) in the guides here.

## Obtaining Data

First determine the base URL \(`$AKASH_NET`\) for the network you want to connect to - use the line from below that corresponds with the network you want to connect to:

```bash
# mainnet
AKASH_NET="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ovrclk/net/master/mainnet"

# testnet
AKASH_NET="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ovrclk/net/master/testnet"

# edgenet
AKASH_NET="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ovrclk/net/master/edgenet"
```

### Version

```bash
AKASH_VERSION="$(curl -s "$AKASH_NET/version.txt")"
```

### Chain ID

The akash CLI will recogonize `AKASH_CHAIN_ID` environment variable when exported to the shell.

```bash
export AKASH_CHAIN_ID="$(curl -s "$AKASH_NET/chain-id.txt")"
```

### Genesis

```bash
curl -s "$AKASH_NET/genesis.json" > genesis.json
```

### Seed Nodes

```bash
curl -s "$AKASH_NET/seed-nodes.txt" | paste -d, -s
```

### Peer Nodes

```bash
curl -s "$AKASH_NET/peer-nodes.txt" | paste -d, -s
```

### RPC Node

Print a random RPC endpoint. The akash CLI will recognize `AKASH_NODE` environment variable when exported to the shell.

```bash
export AKASH_NODE="$(curl -s "$AKASH_NET/rpc-nodes.txt" | shuf -n 1)"

echo $AKASH_NODE
```

### API Node

Print a random API endpoint

```bash
curl -s "$AKASH_NET/api-nodes.txt" | shuf -n 1
```
