# Create your Configuration

Create a deployment configuration [deploy.yaml](https://github.com/akash-network/docs/tree/b65f668b212ad1976fb976ad84a9104a9af29770/guides/deploy/deploy.yml) to deploy the `ovrclk/lunie-light` for [Lunie Light](https://github.com/ovrclk/lunie-light) Node app container using [SDL](https://github.com/akash-network/docs/tree/b65f668b212ad1976fb976ad84a9104a9af29770/sdl/README.md).

You can use cURL to download the file:

```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/akash-network/docs/master/guides/deploy/deploy.yml > deploy.yml
```

### Modify your Configuration

You may use the sample deployment file as-is or modify it for your own needs as described in our [SDL (Stack Definition Language)](https://github.com/akash-network/docs/blob/master/sdl/README.md) documentation. A typical modification would be to reference your own image instead of our demo app image.
