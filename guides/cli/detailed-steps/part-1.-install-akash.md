## **Add Akash Install Location to User’s Path**

Add the software’s install location to the user’s path for easy use of Akash commands.

**NOTE** - below we provide the steps to add the Akash install directory to a user’s path on a Linux Ubuntu server.  Please take a look at a guide for your operating system and how to add a directory to a user’s path.

* Open the user’s path file in an editor:

```
vi /etc/environment
```

* View within text editor prior to the update:

```
PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin"
```

* Add the following directory, which is the Akash install location, to PATH
* In this example the active user is root.  If logged in as another username, replace /root with your current/home directory.

```
/root/bin
```

* View within the text editor following the update:

```
PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin:/root/bin"
```

## Make the Path Active in the Current Session

```
. /etc/environment
```

## Verify Akash Install

* Display the version of Akash software installed. This confirms the software installed and that the new user path addition worked.

```
akash version
```

## Expected/Example Result

```
root@node2:~# akash version

v0.16.3
```

## Source

Installing Akash suite from source:

```
$ go get -d github.com/ovrclk/akash
$ cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/ovrclk/akash
$ git checkout "v$AKASH_VERSION"
$ make deps-install
$ make install
```



Akash is developed and tested with [golang 1.16+](https://golang.org/). Building requires a working [golang](https://golang.org/) installation, a properly set `GOPATH`, and `$GOPATH/bin` present in `$PATH`.

Once you have the dependencies properly setup, download and build `akash` using `make install`
