# CLI

This guide will walk you through installing the Akash CLI, creating and funding an account on an Akash network, and deploying a single-tier web application.

The  command-line client is used to interact with deployments. The `provider-services` command prefix and additional command syntax covered in this guide are utilized to query, launch, and update your applications.

We offer two guides to assist in getting started with the Akash CLI:

* [Detailed Steps](detailed-steps/)
* [Akash CLI Booster](akash-cli-booster/)
