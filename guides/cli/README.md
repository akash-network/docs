# CLI

This guide will walk you through installing the `akash`application, creating and funding an account on an Akash network, and deploying a single-tier web application.

The **Akash** command-line client is used to interact with deployments. The `akash` command is issued to query, launch, and update your applications.

We offer two guides to assist in getting started with the Akash CLI:

* [Detailed Steps](detailed-steps/)
* [Akash CLI Booster](akash-cli-booster/)
