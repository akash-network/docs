# CLI

This guide will walk you through installing the Akash CLI, creating and funding an account on an Akash network, and deploying a single-tier web application.

The **** command-line client is used to interact with deployments. The `provider-services` command prefix is used from the Akash CLI to query, launch, and update your applications.

We offer two guides to assist in getting started with the Akash CLI:

* [Detailed Steps](../../other-resources/experimental/mainnet4-upgrade-docs/detailed-steps/)
* [Akash CLI Booster](akash-cli-booster/)
