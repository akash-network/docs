# Review Bids

## List Bids Received from Providers

```
akash query market bid list
```

## **Choose Provider**

* Note - in the following command we set the AKASH\_PROVIDER address and then reference the environment variable in subsequent commands (create lease, send manifest, etc)
* Alternatively we could add the provider variable to the env.sh script and re-issue **\`**source env.sh\` .  This would negate the need to include the \`--provider\` switch in subsequent commands.
* Replace the provider-address variable with the preferred provider address

```
AKASH_PROVIDER=<provider-address>
```

## Create Lease

```
akash tx market lease create --provider $AKASH_PROVIDER
```

## **Confirm Lease Creation**

```
akash query market lease list
```
