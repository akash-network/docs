Applications can be deployed onto the Akash network using a platform that best suits your needs and preferences. Explore the following guides for your unique use case.

* [Akash Console (web app)](deploy/)
* [Cloudmos Deploy (web app)](cloudmos-deploy/)
* [Using the Command Line for Akash Deployments ](cli/)

## Best Practices

### Image Declaration

* Avoid using `:latest` image tags as Akash Providers heavily cache images
* Additional info on related SDL declarations is available [here](https://docs.akash.network/readme/stack-definition-language#services)
