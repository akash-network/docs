# Sandbox

## Overview

The Akash Sandbox network is intended for short-term workload testing and for new user experimentation.

> _**NOTE**_ - sandbox workloads that have been running for more than 24 hours may be taken down.  Please only use the sandbox for short duration testing.

The Akash Sandbox version matches the current Mainnet version.

Use the following documentation for sandbox use and depending on your preferred deployment tool.

> _**NOTE**_ - this documentation covers the use of the Akash CLI for deployment creation and management.  The [Akash Console](../deploy/) and [Cloudmos Deploy](../cloudmos-deploy/) also now support Sandbox network use.  Simply update the network in Settings from `Mainnet` to `Sandbox` to deploy using these web apps.
