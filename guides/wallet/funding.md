This guide will walk you through funding an account on an Akash network.
Funding your network account is, of course, crucial to using the network - all messages charge a transaction fee, and if
you are deploying applications then the leases for that deployment are paid out of your account.

## Before We Begin

You'll need to know information about the network you're connecting your node to.
See [Choosing a Network](/guides/version.md) for how to obtain any network-related information.

Make sure to have Akash client installed on your workstation, check [install guide](/guides/install.md) for instructions.

You'll need a key to use for your account and your account address handy.  See the [wallet guide](/guides/wallet.md) for how to set this up.

### Shell Variables Required

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|`AKASH_NET`|Akash network configuration base URL. See [here](/guides/version.md).|
|`AKASH_NODE`|Akash network configuration base URL. See [here](/guides/version.md).|
|`ACCOUNT_ADDRESS`|The address of your account.  See [here](/guides/wallet/README.md#account-address).|

# Funding Method

There are a number of different ways to fund your account.  Some work for `mainnet` and some don't; pick an appropriate
option from below for the network you're connecting to.

## Faucet

**Non-`mainnet`** networks will often times have a "faucet" running - a server that will send tokens to your account.  You can see the faucet url by running:

```sh
curl "$AKASH_NET/faucet-url.txt"
```

Go to the resulting URL and enter your account address; you should see tokens in your account shortly.

## Purchasing Tokens

**`mainnet`-only**

Tokens may currently be purchased on bitmax.io.  From there you can withdraw tokens to your address.


## Check Balance

Check your account balance with

```sh
akash \
  --node "$AKASH_NODE" \
  query bank balances "$ACCOUNT_ADDRESS"
```

You should see a non-zero entry containing `uakt` tokens!
