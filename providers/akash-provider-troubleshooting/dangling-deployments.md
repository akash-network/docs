# Dangling Deployments

As part of routine Akash Provider maintenance it is a good idea to ensure that there are no "dangling deployments" in your provider's Kubernetes cluster.

We define a "dangling deployment" as a scenario in which the lease for a deployment was closed but due to a communication issue the associated deployment in Kubernetes is not closed.  Vice versa applies too, where the dangling deployment could sit active on the chain but not on the provider. This should be a rare circumstance but we want to cleanse the provider of any such "dangling deployments" from time to time.

Please use this [Dangling Deployment Script](https://gist.github.com/andy108369/f211bf6c06f2a6e3635b20bdfb9f0fca) to both discover and close any such deployments.
