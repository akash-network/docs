# Deploy Persistent Storage

## **Helm Install**

Install Helm and add the Akash repo if not done previously by following the steps in this [guide](../akash-cloud-provider-build-with-helm-charts/step-4-helm-installation-on-kubernetes-node.md)**.**

All steps in this section should be conducted from the Kubernetes master node on which Helm has been installed.

## **Rook Deployment**

```
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ovrclk/helm-charts/provider-0.172.0/charts/akash-rook/crds.yaml
```

## Persistent Storage Deployment

* **Note** - if any issues are encountered during the Rook deployment, tear down the Rook-Ceph components via the steps listed [here](teardown.md) and begin anew.
* Deployment typically takes approximately 10 minutes to complete**.**

### **Rook YAML File and Desired Settings**

#### Specify Following Settings within the Rook Yaml File

* In the steps that follow in this section we create a `rook.yaml` file to specify persistent storage settings.  Review the default values listed below and include in the rook.yaml file if any non-defaults are needed.
* **Note** - the Helm chart's values.yaml file has a persistent storage class setting equal to `beta2`.  Refer to [Storage Class Types](storage-class-types.md) doc section for further info.  If a different class is needed, include a setting in the rook.yaml file such as:

```
persistent_storage:
  class: beta3
```

* **Note** - using the default Helm Chart values - the build will attempt to use ALL un-initialized disks / partitions on specified nodes.  If this is not desired, include a setting in the rook.yaml file such as:&#x20;
  * `useAllDevices: false`
  * `deviceFilter: "^nvme."`

#### Example rook.yaml File Additions

```
persistent_storage:
  class: beta3

useAllDevices: false
deviceFilter: "^nvme."
```

### Single Persistent Storage Settings

* Use this Helm Chart command in an environment in which a single node will host persistent storage
* Replace `NODE-NAME` in the Helm command provided with the name of the node on which persistent storage will be hosted.  It is important to use the Kubernetes name of the target node as collected from `kubectl get nodes` in a previous step.
* Single persistent storage node build isn't recommended for production and should be used mostly for testing. Refer to the production recommendations [here](deploy-persistent-storage.md#multiple-persistent-storage-nodes-build).

#### Populate the `rook.yaml` **F**ile

```
cat > rook.yaml << EOF
---
nodes:
  - name: "<NODE1>"  # CHANGE to your node name!
    config: ""
EOF
```

#### Example `rook.yaml` file creation

```
cat > rook.yaml << EOF
---
nodes:
  - name: node2
    config: ""
EOF
```

#### Install the Provider Helm Chart

```
helm install akash-rook akash/akash-rook -n akash-services -f rook.yaml
```

### Multiple Persistent Storage Settings

* Use this Helm Chart command in an environment in which multiple nodes will host persistent storage
* Replace `NODE-NAME` in the Helm command provided with the name of the node on which persistent storage will be hosted.  It is important to use the Kubernetes name of the target node as collected from `kubectl get nodes` in a previous step.
* In this example command two nodes are targeted for persistent storage.&#x20;
* In this example command we are using the following Ceph settings:
  * MGR (manager) count 2 which is the minimum recommended value.  Also note that the maximum accepted value is also 2.  Thus this setting should always be of count 2.
  * MON (monitor) count 3 which is the minimum recommended value.
  * OSDs count of 3 which is appropriate for SSD disks.  Adjust `osdsPerDevice` as necessary based on the disk type and the recommended settings [here](persistent-storage-requirements.md).

#### Populate the `rook.yaml` **F**ile

```
cd ~/provider

cat > rook.yaml << EOF
---
mgrCount: 2
monCount: 3
osdsPerDevice: 3
nodes:
  - name: "<NODE1>"  # CHANGE to your node name!
    config: ""
  - name: "<NODE2>"  # CHANGE to your node name!
    config: ""
EOF
```

#### Example `rook.yaml` file

```
cat > rook.yaml << EOF
---
mgrCount: 2
monCount: 3
osdsPerDevice: 3
nodes:
  - name: node2
    config: ""
  - name: node3
    config: ""
EOF
```

#### Install the Provider Helm Chart

```
helm install akash-rook akash/akash-rook -n akash-services -f rook.yaml
```
