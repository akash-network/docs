* A new tab within your browser should launch and Hello Akash World home page should display as demonstrated below
* Note - the URL will be directed to the Ingress Controller of your provider Kubernetes cluster
* If this page does not display properly it would indicate an issue with the providerâ€™s Ingress Controller and we should investigate via the [Provider Troubleshooting guide](../akash-provider-troubleshooting/)
