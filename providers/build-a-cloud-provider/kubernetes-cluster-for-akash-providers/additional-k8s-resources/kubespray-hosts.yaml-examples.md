# Kubespray Hosts.Yaml Examples

## Hosts.Yaml Overview

The Kubespray hosts.yaml inventory file is composed of 3 groups:

* **kube\_node**: list of Kubernetes nodes where the pods will run.
* **kube\_control\_plane**: list of servers where Kubernetes control plane components (apiserver, scheduler, controller) will run.
* **etcd**: list of servers to compose the etcd server. You should have at least 3 servers for failover purpose.

Please following these links for YAML examples and depending on your preferred topology:

* [All-In-One Node](kubespray-hosts.yaml-examples.md#all-in-one-node)
* [One Control Plane Node with Multiple Worker Nodes](kubespray-hosts.yaml-examples.md#one-control-plane-node-with-multiple-worker-nodes)
* [Multiple Control Plane Nodes with Multiple Work Nodes](kubespray-hosts.yaml-examples.md#multiple-control-plane-nodes-with-multiple-work-nodes)

## All-In-One Node

### Topology

* node1 - is a single control plane + etcd node
* node1 - is also running the pods

### &#x20;Pros

* Easy to manage

### Cons

* Single point of failure for K8s/etcd/pods;
* Thinner security barrier since pods are running on control plane / etcd nodes;

### Example Hosts.yaml File

```
  children:
    kube_control_plane:
      hosts:
        node1:
    kube_node:
      hosts:
        node1:
    etcd:
      hosts:
        node1:
    k8s_cluster:
      children:
        kube_control_plane:
        kube_node:
    calico_rr:
      hosts: {}
```

## One Control Plane Node with Multiple Worker Nodes

### Topology

* node1 - single control plane + etcd node
* node2..N - kube nodes where the pods will run

### Pros

* Better security barrier since pods aren't running on control plane / etcd nodes
* Can scale by adding either more control plane nodes or worker nodes

### Cons

* Single point of failure only for K8s/etcd but not the pods

### Example Hosts.yaml File

```
 children:
    kube_control_plane:
      hosts:
        node1:
    kube_node:
      hosts:
        node2:
        node3:
    etcd:
      hosts:
        node1:
    k8s_cluster:
      children:
        kube_control_plane:
        kube_node:
    calico_rr:
      hosts: {}
```

## Multiple Control Plane Nodes with Multiple Work Nodes

### Topology

* Nodes 1.-3 -  the control plane + etcd nodes; (This makes K8s High Available)
* Node 4.-N -  the kube nodes on which the Pods will run

### Pros

* Highly available control plane / etcd
* Better security barrier since pods aren't running on control plane / etcd nodes
* Can scale by adding either more control plane nodes or worker nodes

### Cons

* More complex environment makes its configuration & management more difficult

### Example Hosts.yaml File

```
  children:
    kube_control_plane:
      hosts:
        node1:
        node2:
        node3:
    kube_node:
      hosts:
        node4:
        node5:
        node6:
    etcd:
      hosts:
        node1:
        node2:
        node3:
    k8s_cluster:
      children:
        kube_control_plane:
        kube_node:
    calico_rr:
      hosts: {}
```
