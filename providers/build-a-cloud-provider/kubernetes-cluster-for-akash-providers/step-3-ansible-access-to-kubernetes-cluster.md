# STEP 3 - Ansible Access to Kubernetes Cluster

Ansible will configure the Kubernetes hosts via SSH.  The user Ansible connects with must be root or have the capability of escalating privileges to root.

Commands in this step provide an example of SSH configuration and **** access to Kubernetes hosts and testing those connections.

## Section Overview

The command sets provided in this section may be copied and pasted into your terminal without edit unless otherwise noted.

## **Create SSH Keys on Ansible Host**

* Accept the defaults to create a public-private key pair

```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C $(hostname) -f "$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa" -P "" ; cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

### **Confirm SSH Keys**

* The keys will be stored in the userâ€™s home directory
* Use these commands to verify keys

```
cd ~/.ssh ; ls
```

#### **Example files created**

```
authorized_keys  id_rsa  id_rsa.pub
```

## **Copy Public Key to the Kubernetes Hosts**

### **Template**

* Replace the username and IP address variables in the template with your own settings.  Refer to the Example for further clarification.

```
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub <username>@<ip-address>
```

### **Example**

* Conduct this step for every Kubernetes master and worker node in the cluster

```
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub root@10.88.94.5
```

## **Confirm SSH to the Kubernetes Hosts**

* Ansible should be able to access all **** Kubernetes hosts with no password

### **Template**

* Replace the username and IP address variables in the template with your own settings.  Refer to the Example for further clarification.

```
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa <username>@<ip-address>
```

### **Example**

* Conduct this access test for every Kubernetes master and worker node in the cluster

```
ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa root@10.88.94.5
```
