# STEP 6 - Create Kubernetes Cluster

## Create Cluster

With inventory in place we are ready to build the Kubernetes cluster via Ansible.

* Note - the cluster creation may take several minutes to complete
* If the Kubespray process fails or is interpreted, run the Ansible playbook again and it will complete any incomplete steps on the subsequent run

```
cd ~/kubespray

ansible-playbook -i inventory/akash/hosts.yaml -b -v --private-key=~/.ssh/id_rsa cluster.yml
```
