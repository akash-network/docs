# Akash Provider Attribute Updates

## Initial Guidance and Assumptions

* Conduct all steps in this guide from a Kubernetes control plane node in your Akash Provider cluster.
* Guide assumes that your Akash Provider was installed via Helm Charts as detailed in this [guide](../../providers/build-a-cloud-provider/helm-based-provider-persistent-storage-enablement/).
* Guide assumes that the Kubernetes control plane node used has Helm installed.  Refer to this [guide](../../providers/build-a-cloud-provider/akash-cloud-provider-build-with-helm-charts/step-4-helm-installation-on-kubernetes-node.md) step if a Helm install is needed.  Return to this guide once Helm install is completed.

## Caveats

### Attributes in Active Leases

* If your provider has active leases, attributes that were used during the creation of those leases cannot be updated
* Example - if a lease was created and is active on your provider with `key=region` and `value=us-east`- it would not be possible to update the `region` attribute without closing those active leases prior

## Pre-Update Attribute Captures

* Prior to updating the Provider's attributes, capture the current attributes
* We will use this current capture to compare against the updated provider subsequently

### On Chain Current Attributes Capture

#### Command Template

* Replace the `<provider-address>` variable with the address of your provider

```
provider-services query provider get <provder-address>
```

#### Example Command

```
provider-services query provider get akash1xmz9es9ay9ln9x2m3q8dlu0alxf0ltce7ykjfx
```

#### Expected/Example Output

```
attributes:
- key: region
  value: us-central
- key: host
  value: akash
- key: tier
  value: community
- key: organization
  value: akashtesting

## Provider Update

### Capture Current Provider Settings to File

* Issue this command to capture current provider settings and write to file

```
cd ~

helm -n akash-services get values akash-provider | grep -v ^USER > provider.yaml
```

### Update Provider Settings

* Open the file containing the current provider settings and update attribute key-value pairs as desired

```
cd ~

vi provider.yaml
```

#### Example Provider YAML Update

* If compared to the initial `provider.yaml` file - updates have been made to the `region` and `organization` values have been updated

```
attributes:
- key: region
  value: eu-west
- key: host
  value: akash
- key: tier
  value: community
- key: organization
  value: chainzero
domain: akashtesting.xyz
from: akash1xmz9es9ay9ln9x2m3q8dlu0alxf0ltce7ykjfx
key: <redacted>
keysecret: <redacted>
node: http://akash.c29r3.xyz:80/rpc
withdrawalperiod: 24h
```

### Update Provider

```
cd ~

helm upgrade akash-provider akash/provider -n akash-services -f provider.yaml
```

#### Expected Output of Helm Upgrade

```
Release "akash-provider" has been upgraded. Happy Helming!

## Post Update Verifications

### On Chain Post Update Attributes Verification

#### Command Template

```
provider-services query provider get <provder-address>
```

#### Example Command

```
provider-services query provider get akash1xmz9es9ay9ln9x2m3q8dlu0alxf0ltce7ykjfx
```

#### Expected/Example Output

* Ensure that the new/updated attributes are now active

```
attributes:
- key: region
  value: eu-west
- key: host
  value: akash
- key: tier
  value: community
