# Akash Nodes

Users have a number of options when deploying and using Akash RPC nodes:

* [Omnibus](../operations/akash-node-deployment-via-omnibus.md) - simplifies the Node install process and allows deployment within the Akash cloud or directly into a Docker container
* [Traditional Install](run-an-akash-node/) - step by step instructions for Node installation within any platform
* [Public RPC Nodes](public-rpc-nodes.md) - a listing of available, trusted RPC nodes useful for deployment and query activities
