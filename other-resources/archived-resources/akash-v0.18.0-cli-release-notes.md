# Akash Provider Services v0.1.0 CLI Release Notes

## Overview

Following the release of Akash Mainnet4 - and the associated split of Akash network and provider repositories - new CLI syntax will be introduced.&#x20;

> _**NOTE**_ - The syntax updates are rather simple in that they only impact the beginning of command sets with a shift from `akash` (I.e. `akash tx create`) to `provider-services` (I.e. `provider-services tx create`).

> _**NOTE**_ - please visit this [Detailed CLI Steps](../../guides/cli/detailed-steps/) doc for details on installing the Akash CLI and additional command sets.

In these release notes we detail the new CLI syntax for deployment creation and for the purpose of illustration. The prior CLI command syntax (pre-Mainnet4) will be included for clarity as users transition to a new common syntax.

These changes only impact Akash CLI use and have no impact on application use of Cloudmos Deploy, Praetor App, Akash Helm Charts, etc.
