### Deployment Deposit

* An escrow account is created for the deployment that is deducted from by the provider for the cost of the workload over time
* By default 5 AKT is specified as the initial escrow deposit
* If a deployment's escrow becomes $0 in the future the lease with the provider will be closed.  Consider increasing the initial deposit to an amount that will be enough to fund the deployment for some time.  And/or consider a strategy to ensure the escrow is re-funded on a periodic basis to ensure no disruption to your validator.
* When ready select `DEPOSIT` to proceed and `APPROVE` any Transaction/gas fee prompts that follow

### Select Akash Provider

* A list of Akash Providers that have bid on your deployment is displayed
* Choose the desired Provider from the list and then select `ACCEPT BID` to proceed

![](../../../../.gitbook/assets/validatorSelectProvider.png)

### Deployment Logs

* The `LOGS` pane for the new Deployment will display
* NOTE - after a period of time the logs will display a `Back-off restarting failed container` message.  This is expected as the container will not start until it has established a connection with the TMKMS server in subsequent steps.
* Select the `LEASES` tab to proceed into the next step

### Capture Deployment URI and Port

* In upcoming TMKMS configuration sections we will need to specify our Akash Validator deployment's URI and port
* Capture this info from the `LEASES` tab for later use
* In the example the following values would be captured (these values will be different for your deployment):
  * URI - using the Provider field - `provider.mainnet-1.ca.aksh.pw`
  * Port - using the Forwarded Port field - `31237`
