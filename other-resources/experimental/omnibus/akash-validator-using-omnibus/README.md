# Akash Validator Using Omnibus

## **Overview**

Building an Akash Validator is simplified via the use of Cosmos Omnibus and as detailed in this guide.

The Akash Validator will be built with the following attributes:

* Two Sentry nodes will be created to protect the validator from distributed denial of service (DDOS) attacks
* The Akash Validator will sit behind the Sentry nodes and will not be directly exposed to the internet
* The Sentry nodes and the Akash Validator will launched on the Akash Network as deployments
* This guide will detail the launch of the deployments via the Akashlytics Deploy tool for ease
