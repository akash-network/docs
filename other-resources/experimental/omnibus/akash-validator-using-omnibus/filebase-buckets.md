# FileBase Buckets

The Omnibus framework used to build our Akash Validator will store the following info in a S3 bucket for re-use when a deployment is restarted.  All data stored will be encrypted.

* Validator's private key
* Node IDs - more detail on the use of these IDs later in this guide

## Bucket Creation

We recommend the use of [FileBase](https://console.filebase.com/) S3 buckets for this purpose. If you do not have a FileBase account, create a free account for this use.

Create the following buckets within FileBase for upcoming use in the Validator build.

* akashnode1
* akashnode2
* akashvalidator

## Access Keys

Visit the FileBase \`Access Keys\` menu option and capture the Key and Secret for use in subsequent steps.
