# Akashlytics Deploy Review

While all steps within this guide could be accomplished via the Akash CLI, we will use the Akashlytics Deploy tool as it has become our most popular deploy tool.\
\
If you have not installed Akashlytics prior and/or are not overly familiar with the app, please review our [Akashlytics Deploy documentation](../../../../guides/deploy/) before getting started with the Validator build steps detailed in subsequent sections.
