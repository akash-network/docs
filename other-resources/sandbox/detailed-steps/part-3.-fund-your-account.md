# Fund your Account

Use the Sandbox Faucet to fund your account.  Enter the Akash account created in the prior step (I.e. akash1xxxxxxxxx address) as prompted within the faucet.

We will verify that the faucet properly funded the account in an upcoming, later section.

> _**NOTE**_ - account and funds are only valid for sandbox network use.
