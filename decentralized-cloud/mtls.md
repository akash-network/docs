# Authentication

For tenant it is important to send manifest to the right provider as well as for provider to ensure only owners can access their deployments. Thus each account must [create](mtls.md#manage-certificates) certificate prior deploying workload or starting the provider.

**Note** In this guide `--from` is referring to the key `main` which has been previously created with `akash key add`. Consider changing to the name of yours.

```yaml
- name: main
  type: local
  address: akash1gp3scyd8aye3z8szf3mpqzgsg4csyplcqehxus
  pubkey: akashpub1addwnpepq0np6xltudgnau39046qtty3k46gzd482884hqcfxvzpyf2ttnr8ue3hc55
  mnemonic: ""
  threshold: 0
  pubkeys: []
```

## Manage certificates

By default certificate is valid for 365 days from the moment of issuing

### Create

#### Client \(aka tenant\) certificate

```text
akash tx cert create client --from=main
```

#### Provider certificate

It is important for provider to list same domain\(s\) as hostURI in provider attributes For example if `HostURI: https://example.com` the `example.com` must be listed as one of the domains in the certificate

```text
#akash tx cert create server [list of domains provider is serving on] --from=main
akash tx cert create server example.com example1.com --from=main
```

Locally certificates and it's respective private key are stored in single file in akash home directory. The name of the file is stated as `<address>.pem`. For example certificate created with key `main` the file will be named as `akash1gp3scyd8aye3z8szf3mpqzgsg4csyplcqehxus.pem`

If file already exists user will be prompted to check if certificate already present on chain:

* certificate is **not** on chain: user is prompted whether to commit or to leave as is
* certificate is on chain: user prompted to revoke it or leave as is

To create certificate without being prompted use `--rie` flag \(revoke if exists\)

#### Custom expiration dates

Use following flags to set custom period of validity

* `naf`: valid not after. value either number of days with `d` suffix `364d` or RFC3339 formatted timestamp
* `nbf`: valid not before. value must be RFC3339 formatted timestamp

**Note** flags above are valid for both [client](mtls.md#client-aka-tenant-certificate) and [server](mtls.md#provider-certificate) certificates

**example1**

certificate valid for 180days after issuing

```text
akash tx cert create client --from=main --naf=180d
```

**example2**

certificate valid for 180days after date of start

```text
akash tx cert create client --from=main --naf="2022-03-19T18:35:03-04:00" --naf=180d
```

**example3**

certificate valid for 365days after date of start

```text
akash tx cert create client --from=main --naf="2022-03-19T18:35:03-04:00"
```

### Revoke

```text
akash tx cert revoke --from=main
```

```text
akash tx cert revoke --from=main --serial=<serial #>
```

## Query

To query certificates for particular account

```text
akash query cert list --owner="$(akash keys show main -a)"
```

To filter by state

```text
akash query cert list --owner="$(akash keys show main -a)" --state=valid
akash query cert list --owner="$(akash keys show main -a)" --state=revoked
```
