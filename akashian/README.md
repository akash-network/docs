# Akashian Challenge

Akash means "open space, sky" in ancient Sanskrit.

As a decentralized system, and the world’s first distributed peer-to-peer open cloud computing marketplace, our aim is to materialize the vision of an open cloud that’s as boundless and free as the sky. To this end, we’re leveraging a series of testnets to gather data, identify critical issues, and ensure our network’s scalability, security, and usability before we launch our mainnet. 

These explorations will also enable us to understand our community dynamics and governance, and help us build a healthy and vital community for growth.

The Akashian Challenge focuses on a series of tasks that get progressively more difficult, and enable participants to explore different aspects of the platform, from performing user operations to node operations.

Our Testnet Beta and Akashian Challenge program is inspired by ecosystem projects from the community, such as Solana Tour de Sol, Cosmos Game of Stakes, and Kava Founder Rewards.

## Token Rewards
