# Create your Configuration

Create a deployment configuration `deploy.yml` to deploy an example GPU enabled workload via the steps and SDL provided in this section.

### Akash GPU Enabled Manifest/SDL

You may use the sample deployment file as-is or modify it for your own needs as described in our [SDL (Stack Definition Language)](https://github.com/akash-network/docs/blob/master/sdl/README.md) documentation.

#### EXAMPLE GPU ENABLED SDL:

```bash
cat > deploy.yml <<EOF
