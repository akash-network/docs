# Deployment HTTP Options

Akash deployment SDL services stanza definitions have been augmented to include “http\_options” allowing granular specification of HTTP endpoint parameters.  Inclusion of the parameters in this section are optional but will afford detailed definitions of attributes such as body/payload max size where necessary.

## **Overview**

The following “http\_options” have been introduced in this version.  In subsequent sections of this guide the placement of “http\_options” within the SDL services stanza will be detailed.\


* _**Max\_body\_size**_ - sets the maximum size of an individual HTTP request body
* _**Read\_timeout**_ - duration the proxy will wait for a response from the service&#x20;
* _**Send\_timeout**_ - duration the proxy will wait for the service to accept a request
* _**Next\_cases**_ - defines the cases where the proxy will try another replica in the service.  Reference the upcoming “Next Cases Attribute Usage” section for details pertaining to allowed values.
* _**Next\_tries**_ - number of attempts the proxy will attempt another replica

## **Example HTTP Options Usage**

* Depiction displays the placement and structure of the http\_options key within the greater services section and within a specific service’s expose key.
* Service section of the greater SDL isolated for focus.

* Depiction displays the placement of http\_options within the entire, greater SDL definition

## **Next Cases Attribute Usage**

The “http\_options” key of “next\_cases” accepts an array of values which may contain one or more of the following values.  When included in the “next\_cases” array value - the specified HTTP response code/message will provoke an attempt to service the request by one of the other container members/replicas of the deployment.  The “next\_cases” attempt to service via an additional container will only provoke if the SDL defines a count of greater than one (1).  A deployment with a count of one (1) would have no other replicas to facilitate the additional service attempt.&#x20;
