# Fractional uAKT

Fractional uAKT is the removal of the implicit minimum cost of deployment. In the past, a deployment could not be cheaper than one uAKT per block. Meaning, extremely light workloads like a crypto wallet, or perhaps a personal blog could end up being more expensive than necessary. The limitation also would have more severe consequences as token price increases. A lightweight deployment could increase from $1 to $5 per month if the token were to double or triple in price. With fractional uAKT, prices can be adjusted better so resource consumption can be accurate to the cost.

In this guide we will use the Cloudmos Deploy tool to launch deployments using fractional uAKT. If this is your first time using Cloudmos Deploy, use this [guide](https://github.com/ovrclk/docs/blob/master/features/fractional-uakt/broken-reference/README.md) to install the app and get started.
