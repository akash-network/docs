# Relevant SDL Declaration and Example Use

For the purpose of demonstrating the use of fractional uAKT we will utilize the popular Hello World web application and SDL that can be found in the [Awesome Akash repository](https://github.com/akash-network/awesome-akash). The example SDL file will be modified to take advantage of the new fractional uAKT option.

The [Cloudmos Deploy](https://docs.akash.network/guides/deploy) application will be used to launch the deployment.

## **Example Fractional uAKT Use in Cloudmos Deploy**

Within Cloudmos Deploy:

* [ ] Create a new deployment
* [ ] Select Hello-world from the available templates

## Edit the Template with a Fractional uAKT Amount

* Update the template to use a fractional uAKT amount of 100.1 as seen in the capture
* Additionally ensure that any signBy and attributes sections are removed to mimic the screenshot below
* The necessary template is also shown in text below the screenshot
* Proceed thru the remaining steps to complete the deployment

* The SDL should be as follows post update

```

```

## Verification of Fractional uAKT Use

The verification of fractional uAKT functionality comes in two forms:

1. The deployment progress and will eventually complete with a fractional uAKT per block price of 100.1
2. The bids received from providers come in fractional uAKT amounts

Continue with these steps:

* Select a fractional uAKT bid from a provider and then select “ACCEPT BID”
* Proceed the remaining steps of the deployment process
* When the deployment completes - we have successfully tested fractional uAKT
