The introduction of persistent storage does not affect your pre-existing SDLs.  All manifests authored previously will work as is with no change necessary.

## Troubleshooting Tips

If any errors occur in your deployments of persistent storage workloads, please review the [troubleshooting ](troubleshooting.md)section for possible tips.  We will continue to build on this section if there are any frequently encountered issues.
