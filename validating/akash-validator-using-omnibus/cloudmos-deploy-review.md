While all steps within this guide could be accomplished via the Akash CLI, we will use the Cloudmos Deploy tool as it has become our most popular deploy tool.\
\
If you have not installed Cloudmos prior and/or are not overly familiar with the app, please review our [Cloudmos Deploy documentation](broken-reference) before getting started with the Validator build steps detailed in subsequent sections.
