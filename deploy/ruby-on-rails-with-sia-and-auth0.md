# Ruby on Rails with Sia and Auth0

**Repository**: [ovrclk/akash-on-rails](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash-on-rails)\
**Demo**: [pin.akash.host](https://pin.akash.host/)

This is an example Rails Pinterest clone hosted on Akash. There are a few extra features to make the most of decentralised hosting:

* Database backup/restore to [Sia](https://sia.tech/) via [Filebase](https://filebase.com/).
* User image uploads to [Sia](https://sia.tech/) via [Filebase](https://filebase.com/).
* [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) user authentication.
* [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) DNS and SSL.
* Scheduled tasks using [Whenever](https://github.com/javan/whenever).

## Architecture

### App container

* Runs the rails server and hosts the actual website.
* Connects to the Postgres container for a persistent database.
* Hosts files on [Filebase](https://filebase.com/) ([Sia](https://sia.tech/), [Skynet](https://siasky.net/), and [Storj](https://www.storj.io/) hosting currently).
* Uses [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) for user login and registration.

### Cron container

* Auto-restores the Postgres database on boot, achieving persistent database through re-deploys.
* Auto-backup of the database to [Filebase](https://filebase.com/) every 15 minutes.
* Crontab is defined using [Whenever](https://github.com/javan/whenever) in [`schedule.rb`](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash-on-rails/blob/master/config/schedule.rb).
* Runs the same docker image as the rails application, but running `cron` instead of the rails server.
* A [standalone database backup/restore container](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash-postgres-restore) is also available.

### Postgres container

* Runs a standard Postgres server docker image.

## Usage

Ultimately this repository is designed to provide a sensible example of hosting a rails application on Akash. There are a few ways to use it:

### Run the application as-is on Akash with your own storage and [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) account

* Setup a free [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) account and add your domain and set nameservers.
* Setup a [Filebase](https://filebase.com/) account and bucket.
  * Add a `backups` folder to your bucket.
  * You will need your bucket name, client ID, and secret.
* Sign up for an [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) account and set up an App.
  * Callback URL: [https://yourdomain.com/auth/auth0/callback](https://yourdomain.com/auth/auth0/callback).
  * Logout URL: [https://yourdomain.com](https://yourdomain.com/).
  * You will need your [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) domain, client ID, and secret.
* Using the example deploy.yml, populate the environment variables with the values from [Filebase](https://filebase.com/) and [Auth0](https://auth0.com/).
* Deploy on Akash and get your app URL.
* Point your domain to your app URL using a CNAME in [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).
* Configure 'Full' SSL mode in [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).
* Sign in to your website using [Auth0](https://auth0.com/). The first user created will be made an administrator.

### Use the relevant files in your own project

* [Dockerfile](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash-on-rails/blob/master/Dockerfile)
  * Rails ready Dockerfile.
  * Installs the AWS CLI tool to interact with [Filebase](https://filebase.com/).
* [scripts/run-app.sh](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash-on-rails/blob/master/scripts/run-app.sh)
  * Precompiles rails assets.
  * Runs the rails server.
* [scripts/run-scheduler.sh](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash-on-rails/blob/master/scripts/run-scheduler.sh)
  * Creates and restores the database.
  * Runs rake db:migrate and db:seed.
  * Sets the crontab using [Whenever](https://github.com/javan/whenever) and runs the cron service.
* [scripts/restore-postgres.sh](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash-on-rails/blob/master/scripts/restore-postgres.sh)
  * Downloads latest backup from [Filebase](https://filebase.com/).
  * Restore the DB if a backup was found.
* [scripts/backup-postgres.sh](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash-on-rails/blob/master/scripts/backup-postgres.sh)
  * Backs up the database to [Filebase](https://filebase.com/).
  * Deletes backups older than KEEP\_BACKUPS.
* [config/schedule.rb](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash-on-rails/blob/master/config/schedule.rb)
  * [Whenever](https://github.com/javan/whenever) cron schedule file to run scripts/backup-postgres.sh every 15 minutes.
* [config/initializers/shrine.rb](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash-on-rails/blob/master/config/initializers/shrine.rb)
  * Configures Shrine within the application to use [Filebase](https://filebase.com/) as an S3 host.
* [deploy.yml](https://github.com/ovrclk/akash-on-rails/blob/master/deploy.yml)
  * Akash deploy manifest.

### Clone the repository and use it as a base for a new project

* Clone the repository to your own Github account.
* Rename any occurrence of AkashOnRails, akash-on-rails and, akash\_on\_rails to your own app name.
* Change any app/models, app/controllers, app/views as required.

## Development

You can run the application locally using Docker compose.

Copy the `.env.sample` file to `.env` and populate.

Run `docker-compose up` to build and run the application.
