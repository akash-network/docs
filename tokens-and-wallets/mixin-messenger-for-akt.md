# Mixin Messenger for AKT

The Mixin Messenger app provides an ultra user friendly wallet, with support for almost all popular cryptocurrencies. The app is available on both Google Play Store and App Store.

Mixin Messenger’s name comes from the app not only providing a cryptocurrency wallet but also a secure messaging platform.

We will review the steps to get the Mixin Messenger up and running using an iPhone example. Once the app is active, the process to obtain AKT easily from your mobile device is covered.

* Press the Receive button
* Our goal in this step is to receive ATOM from another account that holds some (I.e. an external wallet or exchange account you hold with ATOM)

![](<../.gitbook/assets/receiveATOM (1).png>)

* You will see a popup suggesting a minimum amount be used in your initial transaction for safety
* Select “Got it” to proceed

![](<../.gitbook/assets/atomDeposit1 (1).png>)

* From the Deposit screen select “Copy” to copy your address to clipboard
* We will use the copied Cosmos address to transfer funds from your pre-existing, external wallet or exchange
* Following the copy of the Cosmos address, visit the external wallet that has ATOM funds and send a minimal amount (I.e. 1 ATOM for initial deposit) to the copied Mixin Messenger address

* You should now see the ATOM in your Mixin Messenger wallet
