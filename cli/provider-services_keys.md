## provider-services keys

Manage your application's keys

### Synopsis

Keyring management commands. These keys may be in any format supported by the
Tendermint crypto library and can be used by light-clients, full nodes, or any other application
that needs to sign with a private key.

The keyring supports the following backends:

    os          Uses the operating system's default credentials store.
    file        Uses encrypted file-based keystore within the app's configuration directory.
                This keyring will request a password each time it is accessed, which may occur
                multiple times in a single command resulting in repeated password prompts.
    kwallet     Uses KDE Wallet Manager as a credentials management application.
    pass        Uses the pass command line utility to store and retrieve keys.
    test        Stores keys insecurely to disk. It does not prompt for a password to be unlocked
                and it should be use only for testing purposes.

kwallet and pass backends depend on external tools. Refer to their respective documentation for more
information:
    KWallet     https://github.com/KDE/kwallet
    pass        https://www.passwordstore.org/

The pass backend requires GnuPG: https://gnupg.org/
